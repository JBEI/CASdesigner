CASdesigner allows for semi-automated design of DNA for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated
genomic editing. It includes experimental data on genetic parts (integration
loci, promoters, protein tags) generated in-house to help the user select parts
that provide a desired expression pattern. It is part of a toolkit of (1) a
Cas9/gRNA system to integrate a markerless cassette for deletions, mutations, or
insertions at a desired chromosomal site, (2) experimental data on genomic
sites, (3) on promoters, and (4) modular protein tags to control protein
localization, stability, and solubility. Possible uses are to easily design
primers to integration expression cassettes.



Installation
============
To run the Jupyter notebook you need Python 2.7 with the following packages
installed:

* Jupyter
* Biopython
* Intermine
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Xlrd

Start the Jupyter server, then browse to the CASdesigner directory and click on
"CASdesigner_beta.ipynb".



Installation (for developers)
=============================
If you know how to use Vagrant [https://www.vagrantup.com/], you can use it to
create a virtual machine with all the prerequisites installed.


After installing Vagrant, go to the CASdesigner directory and run

    vagrant up

This will take a while as all the prerequisites are downloaded and installed.
Once it is done, browse to `localhost:8888` to view the notebook (you can change
the port in the Vagrantfile).



How to use CASdesigner
======================
See manual.docx for help. Thanks.


CASdesigner as a Web app
========================
A Web app version of CASdesigner is running at http://casdesigner.jbei.org/ .
You can find the source code at this git repo:
